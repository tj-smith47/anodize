# Release pipeline

The keys that drive the release itself: GitHub/GitLab/Gitea release surface,
changelog generation, announcers, cloud uploads, and custom publishers.

## Release and changelog

| Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `release.github` | ✅ Verified | [anodizer releases](https://github.com/tj-smith47/anodizer/releases). Header/footer/draft/prerelease/make_latest all exercised |
| `release.metadata` | ✅ Verified | [v0.1.1 metadata.json](https://github.com/tj-smith47/anodizer/releases/download/v0.1.1/metadata.json) · [artifacts.json](https://github.com/tj-smith47/anodizer/releases/download/v0.1.1/artifacts.json) |
| `release.name_template` / `tag_template` | ✅ Verified | cfgd uses Tera-templated tags across 4 workspace crates |
| `release.header` / `footer` | ✅ Verified | Visible at the bottom of every shipped release body |
| `changelog.groups` | ✅ Verified | "Features" / "Bug Fixes" / "Others" sections in the [v0.1.1 release body](https://github.com/tj-smith47/anodizer/releases/tag/v0.1.1) |

| `release.gitlab` | 🤝 Help wanted | We dogfood on GitHub only |
| `release.gitea` | 🤝 Help wanted | We dogfood on GitHub only |
| `milestones[]` | ✅ Verified | Wired |

## Announcers

13 channels implemented. Two are exercised by live cfgd releases; the
others have full test coverage but no live secrets configured.

| Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `announce.webhook` | ✅ Verified | cfgd posts to a custom webhook on every release |
| `announce.smtp` | ✅ Verified | cfgd sends release announcements via SMTP |
| `announce.discord` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.slack` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.telegram` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.teams` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.mattermost` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.reddit` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |

| `announce.linkedin` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.opencollective` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |

## Blob and artifactory uploads

| Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `blobs[]` (S3 / GCS / Azure) | 🤝 Help wanted | `object_store` SDK wired. No release configures cloud credentials |
| `artifactories[]` | 🤝 Help wanted | Target, mode, TLS, headers wired; no live deployment |
| `uploads[]` | 🤝 Help wanted | Generic HTTP upload wired; no live deployment |
| `furies[]` | 🤝 Help wanted | Implemented; no live credentials |
| `cloudsmiths[]` | 🤝 Help wanted | Wired in [cfgd's config](https://github.com/tj-smith47/cfgd/blob/master/.anodizer.yaml) with a live `CLOUDSMITH_TOKEN`; uploads currently fail at HTTP layer so no package has landed in the `jarvispro/cfgd` repo. Awaiting endpoint debug |

## Custom publishers

| Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `publishers[]` | ✅ Verified | Run a custom command per artifact. Wired |
